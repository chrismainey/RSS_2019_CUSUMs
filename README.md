This repository contains the slides, a couple of scripts used for my
talk at the Royal Statistical Society Conference 2019, on 5th September
2019.

I did want to share more, but I canâ€™t share patient data, nor anything
that is UH intellectual properly. Instead, we will use the Medicare
dataset `medpar` in the `COUNT` package see
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COUNT/index.html) entry.
