This repository contains the slides, a couple of scripts used for my talk at the Royal Statistical Society Conference 2019, on 5th September 2019.

I did want to share more, but I can't share patient data, nor anything that is UHB's intellectual property.  Instead, we will use the Medicare dataset `medpar` in the `COUNT` package see [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COUNT/index.html) entry.

We will also be using my `FunnelPlotR` package:
```{r inst, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("FunnelPlotR")
```

You can find it on GitHub [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FunnelPlotR/index.html) and the package docs [here](https://chrismainey.github.io/FunnelPlotR/)
